- 👋 Hi, I’m @shweta-joshi-programmer
- 👀 I’m interested in working on programming as a skill and a way to uplift my life.
- 🌱 I’m currently unlearning, and re-learning the following languages : C, and Java.
-    I'm also learning new skills... will update those soon. 
-    Here, to share my projects and new skills, and to learn a lot from fellow GitHubites.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Julia project...
- Happy programming :) :)
